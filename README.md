The repository contains python codebase for computing ALIS scores. The score is an indicator of an authors eminence outside his genealogy network. This score is computed by creating a model inspired from CES production function. Model uses author-centric parameteres, NGC, NCC, OCQ, h-index and i-10 index to build a ranking mechanism to rank authors who have been working on a specific domain. Eight renowned authors from Mathematics domain with different level of expertise and contributions are selected carefully. Their genealogy and community networks are traversed and compared for testing the model. Relevant citations from their network are derived and utilized for calculating NGC, NCC and OCQ. Along with h-index and i10 index, obtained from Web of Science repository, the parameters are passed to the model for ALIS scores.
